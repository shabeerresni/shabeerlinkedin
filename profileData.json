This fabrication work supports the assembly and integration of INSAT satellite systems, which are critical for communication and meteorological functions. The project emphasises high-precision machining of structural and avionics mounting parts, ensuring conformity to stringent aerospace standards for flight hardware used in India's INSAT satellite program. The work at VSSC's specialised facilities in Thumba showcases their capability for advanced hardware production essential to satellite launch vehicle subsystems and satellite payloads"
